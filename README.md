# restaurant-menu-app

This project is a simple single-page application showcasing a restaurant menu with the ability to add items to an order and process payments. It was created to delve deeper into **Essential JavaScript concepts** such as:

- DOM Manipulation
- Events and Event Handlers
- Data Structures (Arrays and Objects)
- Array Methods (e.g., `map()`, `forEach()`, `find()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`, `join()`)
- Conditional Rendering (based on application state)
- Basic Error Handling
- Import and export modules

## Features

- **Dynamic Menu Rendering:**  
  Fetch and display a menu list from a data source (`data.js`) using JavaScript.
  
- **Add/Remove Items from Order:**  
  Add menu items to an order and remove them from it. The total price updates dynamically.
  
- **Modal Payment Window:**  
  A modal allows the user to enter payment information and finalize the order.
